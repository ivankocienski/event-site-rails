# Widgets?

Bits of code that render HTML.

For when helper methods need helper methods.

An experiment.

All code is completely isolated from rails, so it should work entirely on just inputs sent in.

## Objective

1. Take complex code out of helpers
2. Make that complex code easier to read by breaking it up.
3. Hopefully tests?
