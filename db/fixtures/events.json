Dalston Superstore presents our\nannual staff tran healthcare fundraiser the Trans Day of Visibility,\nwith all proceeds going to Superstore staff gender affirming funds. We\nneed to relinquish the idea that visibility is positive in and of\nitself. The hyper visibility that trans\\* people have experienced in the\npast decade has left us increasingly vulnerable to violence from both\nthe public and the government while continuously being neglected by\nsocial services, including the NHS. The increased exposure of trans\\*\npeople has not improved our access to gender affirming health care.\nRather, we are left hanging with an expected waiting time of more than\nfive years for an initial appointment at the Gender Identity Clinic.\nFundraisers and privatised health care should not replace the public\nhealthcare system but for most trans\\* people, this is currently our\nonly option. Thus, health care becomes a matter of proximity to\nprivilege. We as trans\\* people should get to define for ourselves\nwhether and how we choose to transition medicially, legally and\nsocially. On this Trans Day of In/visibility, we encourage you to seize\nthe means of medical transition to redistribute resources, including but\nnot limited to money, HRT, and knowledge. In an attempt to? do so,\nDalston Superstore is throwing a fundraising party to support gender\naffirming health care for the staff of Dalston Superstore.

Charlize Theron leads a group of immortal mercenaries who\nhave survived centuries in secrecy only to find themselves hunted in\npresent day by those seeking to harness their power for themselves.\nThese ancient soldiers realise the fight is on just as the presence of a\nnew immortal complicates things further. The Old Guard marked the first\nmajor Hollywood comicbook adaptation by a black woman, and despite being\ndropped on Netflix painfully undermarketed and consequently underseen,\nPrince-Bythewood’s film is a slice of genre excellence that marries an\nall-star cast – including Kiki Layne (If Beale Street Could Talk), and\nMatthias Schoenaerts (Rust and Bone) – with the sensibilities of similar\nfilms from the 2000s like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Underworld, and the\noriginal few X-Men. In short, it’s a film about people fighting and\nlooking extremely cool while doing it. Not only does The Old Guard offer\nthe chance to see reigning Bicon and Transmissions favourite Charlize do\nwhat she does best, but there’s more gayness to be had! A romance\nbetween two of the immortal men is functionally the beating heart of the\nfilm, and we think you’ll enjoy a rare chance to see explicitly queer\ncharacters in a big-budget genre film as much as we did.

Gird your\nloins and say your prayers, because The Witch (2015) is here to curdle\nyour blood. One of the most triumphant debut features of all-time,\nEggers’ immersive New-England folktale also marked the debut of Anya\nTaylor-Joy, who launched an enormous career after her performance here\nas Thomasin, the eldest child of Christian puritans, excommunicated from\nthe church for the extremity of their beliefs and forced to live off the\nland while superstition, isolation, and unknown forces lay waste to\ntheir family. Hailed upon release by The Satanic Temple as\ntransformative and empowering, The Witch is ultimately a story about who\nsuffers most under religious oppression and patriarchy, and within its\nchilling Horror trappings is one of the most compelling depictions of\nresistance to those powers put to film.  We invite you to venture\ndownstairs to the deep dark of Dalston Superstore’s basement where we’ll\nusher in October’s month of Horror programming a little early with a\nscreening of one of the very best the genre has to offer.   Tickets\navailable via OutSavvy Subtitles will be displayed throughout the film.\nSeating is a mixture of benches, backed chairs, bar stools, and floor\nspace, and is first come, first served.","summary":"Transmissions presents THE WITCH (2015)","startDate":"2023-09-26T20:00:00+01:00","endDate":"2023-09-26T23:00:00+01:00","publisherUrl":null,"address":{"streetAddress":"117 Kingsland High St","postalCode":"E8 2PB"},"organizer":{"id":"198"}},{"id":"334697","name":"LGBTQ+ Ballet","description":"LGBTQ+ friendly beginners and intermediate ballet class.

Making sounds and noises never to be repeated (and often ugly\nor unmusical) feels cathartic, triumphant and playful. Leaning into the\nsituationists\\' concept of dérive, this approach to sound creates an\nantidote to the highly structured world we live in today.*\n\n*  \n *\n\n*⛢ Lucinda Chua*\n\n* *\n\n*Artist, composer &amp; multi-instrumentalist Lucinda Chua released her\ndebut solo album “YIAN” on 4ad earlier this year. Prior to this Chua\nwrote, recorded and performed under the moniker “Felix;” releasing two\nalbums on American independent record label kranky. As a cellist Chua\nhas toured as part of FKA twigs and Stars of the Lid. In 2019 she\nco-wrote the soundtrack to the feature documentary 30HA.*\n\n*  \n  \n *\n\n*⛢ Fran Lobo*\n\n* *\n\n*Fran Lobo is a British- Asian singer, songwriter, producer and\nperformer. She has just released her debut album ‘Burning It Feels Like’\non Heavenly Recordings on 18 August 2023. The album was accompanied by\nthree self directed short film/music videos which explored dance,\ntheatre and fantasy.  Previously, she released the Brave EP on Slowdance\nrecordings as well as performing live with UNKLE on their world tours.\nHer work often explores dreams/reality, a search for identity and a\nsense of horror which often results in collagist and chopped and screwed\ncompositions.*\n\n*  \n  \n  \n *\n\n*⛢ Laura Groves *\n\n* *\n\n*Laura Groves is an artist and producer from Bradford, West Yorkshire.\nHer album “Radio Red” was released on Bella Union in August 2023,\nfollowing on from her “Private Road” EP, releases on XL Recordings as\nBlue Roses and EPs “Thinking About Thinking” and “Committed Language” on\nDEEK Recordings. She is a frequent collaborator and has spent over a\ndecade producing a body of work through a passion for\nhome/self-recording and layering of voices, acoustic and synthesised\nsounds. Her latest album was accompanied by self-directed video work and\nshe currently hosts an NTS Radio show called Desire Paths, alongside a\nseries of collaborative improvised music nights of the same name.*\n\n*  \n  \n  \n *\n\n*⛢ Auclair *\n\n* *\n\n*Auclair is a British-Rwandan music and sound artist. Her work explores\nrhythm, voice and electronica - treating everyday life like new\nmythologies and taking an embodied approach to exploring ideas with\nsound. Alongside a series of releases, her versatility has led to a wide\nrange of multidisciplinary projects and collaborations. Her latest EP\nGiramata is out now on Amorphous Sounds, written/recorded/produced by\nAuclair, with additional production and mix from Kwes (Warp Records) and\nvisuals by Dark Angel Services.*\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.outsavvy.com/event/15968/arthaus-present-hxan-with-live-score","summary":"ArtHaus present Häxan with live score","startDate":"2023-10-18T19:00:00+01:00","endDate":"2023-10-18T22:00:00+01:00","publisherUrl":"https://www.vfdalston.com/our-events/2023/10/18/arthaus-present-hxan-with-live-score","address":{"streetAddress":"66 Stoke Newington Rd","postalCode":"N16 7XB"},"organizer":{"id":"191"}},{"id":"367414","name":"Monthly Mix + Mingle","description":"A low pressure mix & mingle event presented by A Whole Orange for queers\nlooking for connection – whether that’s friendship, dating &/or\ncommunity You can expect a room full of lovely lgbtq+ babes, some\nconversation cards and CONNECTION!

WE’RE BACK. Tickets for our first event of 2023 are on\nsale now. We’ve had such an incredible time taking QHP on the road, but\nwe’ve been missing what we love most - creating our own spaces to share\nwith our community. Bringing together radical and liberatory politics\nwith some of the best performances, music, and art from the DIY queer\nscene. NEW VENUE: We’ve found our new home at Studio 9294, Hackney Wick.\nIt’s a huge warehouse space with multiple rooms - meaning we will have a\nstacked lineup across two rooms with spaces to watch shows, dance, and\nchill. TRANS PPL TO THE FRONT: Queer House Party is run by a\npredominantly trans team - and while we are a queer party, moving\nforward, we’re going to be centering the ongoing fight for trans\nliberation and the trans community at all of our parties. Queer House\nParty is for everyone - but trans people to the front. EVERYONE IN:\nWe’ve done our best to keep ticket prices down for everyone. Tickets are\non a sliding scale from £7.50-17.50. If this is still a barrier for you,\nplease drop us a message, and we will add you to our free list. IMPROVED\nONLINE PARTY: In true alignment with our roots as a party that started\nonline, we still run our events with live-streams so that anyone can be\nincluded in the club, regardless of geography, financial situation,\ndisability, and other needs. To make this happen, we’re working with a\nbrand new streaming service, CastRooms. We’re talking multiple cameras\nwith high-quality video and audio for everyone who wants to join us\nvirtually. SAME ACCESS: Studio 9294 is a wheelchair-accessible venue.\nBoth our IRL and URL events will have BSL, AD, and CC available during\nthe shows. Free tickets are available for carers and PAs. We will be\nfollowing this post up with a more detailed breakdown of the space, but\nif you have any specific questions, drop us a line at\nqueerhouseparty@gmail.com.COVID POLICY: We ask that everyone tests\nbefore attending to try and keep the party as safe as possible. If you\ncan’t get hold of a test before the event, there will be a covid testing\nstation outside the venue. We will not ask for proof that you have\ntested.

Dalston Superstore presents our\nannual staff healthcare fundraiser for Trans Day of Visibility, with all\nproceeds going to Superstore staff gender affirming funds. We need to\nrelinquish the idea that visibility is positive in and of itself. The\nhyper visibility that trans\\* people have experienced in the past decade\nhas left us increasingly vulnerable to violence from both the public and\nthe government while continuously being neglected by social services,\nincluding the NHS. The increased exposure of trans\\* people has not\nimproved our access to gender affirming health care. Rather, we are left\nhanging with an expected waiting time of more than five years for an\ninitial appointment at the Gender Identity Clinic. Fundraisers and\nprivatised health care should not replace the public healthcare system\nbut for most trans\\* people, this is currently our only option. Thus,\nhealth care becomes a matter of proximity to privilege. We as trans\\*\npeople should get to define for ourselves whether and how we choose to\ntransition medicially, legally and socially.

William\nFriedkin (The Exorcist, Sorcerer) reached a great many heights in his\nstoried career, but perhaps the filmmaker’s most fascinating achievement\nis Cruising (1980), a dark and seductive thriller starring Al Pacino as\na NYC cop sent undercover to find a serial killer targeting men in the\ncity’s underground of gay kink, where he must disappear into the fetish\nclubs, meat markets, and cruising grounds that populate the night-time\nlandscape. Whether he’ll survive, and if he’ll still be the same person\nif he does, remains to be seen.\n\nThroughout it’s production in 1979, Cruising was dogged by protestors\nfrom New York’s gay community who believed the piece to be so homophobic\nthat there were numerous elaborate disruptions during filming, which\ncontinued upon theatrical release. But despite the controversy of the\nday, Friedkin’s film has only become more and more beloved in subsequent\nyears by queer audiences who have found it impossible not to appreciate\nits nuances, grime, and invaluable nature as a time capsule of the\nleather scene.\n\n“There’s a lot you don’t know about me.”\n\nBefore Cruising, not only you can join us for a screening of Hardy\nHaberman‘s documentary short Leather (1996), which captures testimonies\nfrom various leather lovers on the freedom found in the dynamics of\nBDSM, you’ll also be able to purchase custom leather pieces by Dalston\nroyalty Malwina, ranging from cuffs, to studded bracelets, to harnesses\nand more.\n\nFind all this downstairs at Dalston Superstore, it’s gonna be quite a\nnight.\n\nTickets available via\nOutSavvy: https://www.outsavvy.com/organiser/transmissions\n\nSubtitles will be displayed throughout the film.

Five Prime Ministers, four elections,\none referendum, countless scandals, a pandemic, an historic cost of\nliving crisis, over a decade of cuts to basic services, welfare and\nsocial support, with over 330,000 deaths associated with them. A country\nthat, many would argue, has been broken – we can only hope not beyond\nrepair. Many of us have marched, fought, campaigned and tried to. Those\nresponsible, among them our current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, look\nfinally set to be handed their marching orders in just a few short\nweeks. If polls are to be believed the 4th of July will be the final day\nof Sunak’s premiership and we thought we should send arguably the\nrichest man to ever be elected to Parliament off in style. There is no\nplace we’d rather get together and collectively scream “good riddance”\nthan in the hallowed hall (basement) of Dalston Superstore. Starting\nfrom 9pm on 4 July, we’ll be screening the election results live, going\nlate into the night with an incredible roster of DJs curated by our good\nfriends Queer House Party. Huck’s Digital Editor and resident\ngobshite Ben Smoke will be on hand to keep us abreast of developments\nthrough the early hours, as we watch and celebrate (hopefully) the\ndemise of so many of those who have brought misery to millions. Don’t\ntell anyone but we may also have a few extra surprises lined up for you\non the night… Of course, what comes next is not set. Indeed, even if\nKeir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party does become the next Prime\nMinister, as it looks likely he will, the fight both at home and abroad\nis far from over. It’s why we’re taking the opportunity to fundraise for\nthose currently at the centre of a genocide that many say\nStarmer provided political cover for. All profits from the night will be\ngoing directly to organisations at the heart of providing vital\nhumanitarian assistance to those in Gaza. We are still a few weeks out\nfrom the night and we’ll be doing a full line-up and beneficiary reveal\nin the run up to the event over on our socials so be sure to follow if\nyou don’t already! THERE ARE NO ADVANCED TICKETS so you’ll need to get\nthere early, particularly if you want to join in our epic exit poll\ncelebration at 10pm. As extra incentive (as if you need any?!), we’ll be\ngiving away free copies of Huck 75, with legend Zarah Sultana on the\ncover to the first 100 people through the door! It’s been a hard,\nunrelenting few years – a simultaneously frantic and extraordinarily\ndull election campaign, and an uncertain future awaits us all but on 4\nJuly, let’s all get together to celebrate, to take the night to think of\nall we’ve lost, all we’ve achieved and all we’re yet to win.

We recommend them because: track cycling is great for general bike handling skills (you\\'re on a fixed gear bike), fitness (no stopping for traffic lights!) and confidence.  \n\n[1]: http://hernehillvelodrome.com","summary":"HHV Women\\'s Training","startDate":"2024-09-01T17:00:00+01:00","endDate":"2024-09-01T19:00:00+01:00","publisherUrl":null,"address":null,"organizer":{"id":"133"}},{"id":"383636","name":"Queer Art Social","description":"Monthly Queer Art Club workshops that connect queer people through art\nand creativity.","summary":"Queer Art Social","startDate":"2024-09-01T18:30:00+01:00","endDate":"2024-09-01T20:30:00+01:00","publisherUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/queer-art-social-tickets-937526295387","address":{"streetAddress":"60-62 Hopton Street, Blackfriars","postalCode":"SE1 9JH"},"organizer":{"id":"125"}},{"id":"381409","name":"Trans Admin Group","description":"A peer support space to tackle the sometimes stressful work of name\nchanges, medical appointments, passport applications and more admin.","summary":"Trans Admin Group","startDate":"2024-09-01T18:30:00+01:00","endDate":"2024-09-01T20:30:00+01:00","publisherUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/trans-admin-group-tickets-913972585607","address":{"streetAddress":"60-62 Hopton Street, Blackfriars","postalCode":"SE1 9JH"},"organizer":{"id":"125"}},{"id":"364417","name":"HHV Women\\'s Track Induction/Taster session","description":"An introduction to track cycling for riders of all abilities, where\nyou\\'ll learn the basic skills that enable you to access a variety of\ntraining sessions at Herne Hill Velodrome.\n\nMonthly on the first Sunday of the month.
